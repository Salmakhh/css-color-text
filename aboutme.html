        Hello! My name is Salma. I am originally from Egypt and am currently living in San Jose with my Husband and 2 toddlers, who are somewhat considered pets right!.
        <br />
        I have a bachelor degree in Design and Applied Arts and would like to venture into the world of web development and app design.
        <br />
        I am really enjoying my web development class and am currently learning so much thanks to Sergio who is an amazing teacher.
